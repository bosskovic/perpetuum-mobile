### Enjoy The Ride

Shut the gates and sunset  
After that you can't get out  
You can see the bigger picture  
Find out what itâ€™s all about  
You're open to the skyline  
You won't want to go back home  
In a garden full of angels  
You will never be alone  

But oh the road is long  
The stones that you are walking on  
Have gone  

With the moonlight to guide you  
Feel the joy of being alive  
The day that you stop running  
Is the day that you arrive  

And the night that you got locked in  
Was the time to decide  
Stop chasing shadows  
Just enjoy the ride  

If you close the door to your house  
Don't let anybody in  
It's a room that's full of nothing  
All that underneath your skin  
Face against the window  
You can't watch it fade to grey  
And you'll never catch the fickle wind  
If you choose to stay  

But oh the road is long  
The stones that you are walking on  
Have gone  

With the moonlight to guide you  
Feel the joy of being alive  
The day that you stop running  
Is the day that you arrive  

And the night that you got locked in  
Was the time to decide  
Stop chasing shadows  
Just enjoy the ride  

Stop chasing shadows  
Just enjoy the ride

### Over and over

Waking to these sounds again  
I wonder how I'll sleep  
Passing out is taking off into the stubborn deep  
I'd like to meet a human who makes it all seem clear  
To work out all these cycles and why I'm standing here  
I'm falling  

Over and over and over and over again now  
Calling and over and over and over and over again now  

Running through my life right now  
I don't regret a thing  
The things I do just make me laugh and make me wanna drink  
I'd like to meet a mad man who makes it all seem sane  
To work out all these troubles and what there is to gain  
I'm falling  

Over and over and over and over again now  
Calling and over and over and over and over again now  

Projecting what I want is always hard to know  
But when it comes between my sights I'll let the damage show  

I'd like to meet a space man, who's got it going on  
Sailing through the stars at night 'til our world is gone  
I'm falling  

Over and over and over and over again now  
Calling and over and over and over and over again now  

Over and over and over and over again now  
Calling and over and over and over and over again now
