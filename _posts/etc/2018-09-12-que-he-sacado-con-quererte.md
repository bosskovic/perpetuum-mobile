What have I gained from the moon that we both watched together  
What have I gained with the names written on the wall  
Just like the calendar changes, so changes everything in this world  
Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay  

What have I gained from the lily that we planted in the patio  
It wasn't just one who was planting it, but two lovers  
Gardener, your garden has not changed with time  
Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay  

What have I gained from the shadow of the aromo tree for a witness  
And the trace of four feet by the road side  
What have I gained from loving you, little carnation in bloom  
Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay  

Here is the same moon, and in the patio the white lily  
The two names on the wall and your trail on the road  
But you, ungrateful dove, no longer coo in my nest  
Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay
