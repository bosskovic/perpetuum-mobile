description:  "Konceptualni album Anaïs Mitchell iz 2010. godine, koji obrađuje mit o Orfeju i Euridici i smešta ga u post-apokaliptični 
               kontekst ekonomske depresije. Album je kasnije proširen dodatnim numerama i poslužio je kao osnova za mjuzikl."

### Wedding Song

[EURYDICE]  
Lover, tell me, if you can  
Who’s gonna buy the wedding bands?  
Times being what they are  
Hard, and getting harder all the time  

[ORPHEUS]  
Lover, when I sing my song  
All the rivers sing along  
And they’re gonna break their banks for me  
To lay their gold around my feet  
All a-flashing in the pan  
All to fashion for your hand  
The rivers are gonna give us the wedding band  

[EURYDICE]  
Lover, tell me, if you’re able  
Who’s gonna lay the wedding table?  
Times being what they are  
Dark, and getting darker all the time  

[ORPHEUS]  
Lover, when I sing my song  
All the trees are gonna sing along  
And bend their branches down to me  
To lay their fruit around my feet  
The almond and the apple  
And the sugar from the maple  
The trees gonna lay the wedding table  

[EURYDICE]  
Lover, tell me, when we’ll wed  
Who’s gonna make the wedding bed?  
Times being what they are  
Hard, and getting harder all the time  

[ORPHEUS]  
Lover, when I sing my song  
All the birds gonna sing along  
And they’ll come flying round to me  
To lay their feathers at my feet  
And we’ll lie down in eiderdown  
A pillow ’neath our heads  
The birds are gonna make the wedding bed  
And the trees are gonna lay the wedding table  
And the rivers are gonna give us the wedding band

### Epic (Part I)

[ORPHEUS]  
King of diamonds, king of spades  
Hades was king of the kingdom of dirt  
Miners of mines, diggers of graves  
They bowed down to Hades who gave them work  
And they bowed down to Hades who made them sweat  
Who paid them their wages and set them about  
Digging and dredging and dragging the depths  
Of the earth to turn its insides out, singing  
La la la la la la la…  

King of mortar, king of bricks  
The River Styx was a river of stones  
And Hades laid them high and thick  
With a million hands that were not his own  
And a million feet that fell in line  
And stepped in time with Hades’ step  
And a million minds that were just one mind  
Like stones in a row  
Stone by stone  
Row by row  
The river rose up, singing  
La la la la la la la…

### Way Down Hadestown

[HERMES]  
Follow that dollar for a long way down  
Far away from the poorhouse door  
Either get to hell or to Hadestown  
Ain’t no difference anymore!  
Way down Hadestown  
Way down under the ground  
Hound dog howl and the whistle blow  
Train comes a-rollin, clickety-clack  
Nobody knows where that old train goes  
Those who go they don’t come back  
Way down Hadestown  
Way down under the ground  

[PERSEPHONE]  
Winter’s nigh and summer’s o’er  
I hear that high and lonesome sound  
Of my husband coming for  
To bring me home to Hadestown  
Way down Hadestown  
Way down under the ground  

[EURYDICE]  
Everybody dresses in clothes so fine  
Everybody’s pockets are weighted down  
Everybody sipping ambrosia wine  
In a goldmine in Hadestown  
Way down Hadestown  
Way down under the ground  

[ORPHEUS]  
Everybody hungry, everybody tired  
Everybody slaves by the sweat of his brow  
The wage is nothing and the work is hard  
It’s a graveyard in Hadestown  
Way down Hadestown  
Way down under the ground  

[THE FATES]  
Every little penny in the wishing well  
Every little nickel on the drum  
All them shiny little heads and tails  
Where do you think they come from?  
They come from way down Hadestown  
Way down under the ground  

[ORPHEUS & HERMES]  
Mister Hades is a mean old boss  
With a silver whistle and a golden scale  
An eye for an eye!  
And he weighs the cost  
A lie for a lie!  
And your soul for sale  
Sold!  
To the king on the chromium throne  
Thrown!  
To the bottom of a sing-sing cell  
Where the little wheel squeal and the big wheel groan  
And you better forget about your wishing well  
Way down Hadestown  
Way down under the ground  

[EURYDICE]  
Mr. Hades is a mighty king  
Must be making some mighty big deals  
Seems like he owns everything  
Kind of makes you wonder how it feels  
Way down Hadestown  
Way down under the ground  
Way down Hadestown  
Way down under the ground  
Way down under the ground  
Way down under the ground

### Hey, Little Songbird

[HADES]  
Hey, little songbird, give me a song  
I’m a busy man and I can’t stay long  
I got clients to call, I got orders to fill  
I got walls to build, I got riots to quell  
And they’re giving me hell back in Hades  
Hey, little songbird, cat got your tongue?  
Always a pity for one so pretty and young  
When poverty comes to clip your wings  
And knock the wind right out of your lungs  
Hey, nobody sings on empty  

[EURYDICE]  
Strange is the call of this strange man  
I want to fly down and feed at his hand  
I want a nice soft place to land  
I wanna lie down forever  

[HADES]  
Hey, little songbird, you got something fine  
You’d shine like a diamond down in the mine  
And the choice is yours if you’re willing to choose  
Seeing as you’ve got nothing to lose  
And I could use a canary  

[EURYDICE]  
Suddenly nothing is as it was  
Where are you now, Orpheus?  
Wasn’t it always the two of us  
Weren’t we birds of a feather?  

[HADES]  
Hey, little songbird, let me guess  
He’s some kind of poet and he’s penniless  
Give him your hand, he’ll give you his hand-to-mouth  
He’ll write you a poem when the power’s out  
Hey, why not fly south for the winter?  
Hey, little songbird, look all around you  
See how the vipers and vultures surround you  
They’ll take you down, they’ll pick you clean  
If you stick around such a desperate scene  
See, people get mean when the chips are down

### Gone, I’m Gone

[EURYDICE]  
Orpheus, my heart is yours  
Always was and will be  
It’s my gut I can’t ignore  
Orpheus, I’m hungry  
Oh, my heart, it aches to stay  
But the flesh will have its way  
Oh, the way is dark and long  
I’m already gone, I’m gone  

[THE FATES]  
Go ahead and lay the blame  
Talk of virtue, talk of sin  
Wouldn’t you have done the same?  
In her shoes, in her skin  
You can have your principles  
When you’ve got a bellyful  
But hunger has a way with you  
There’s no telling what you’re gonna do  
When the chips are down  
Now that the chips are down  
What you gonna do when the chips are down?  
Now that the chips are down

Ain’t nobody but yourself to trust

Now that the chips are down  
What you gonna do when the chips are down?  
Now that the chips are down  
And the first shall be first  
And the last shall be last  
Cast your eyes to heaven  
You get a knife in the back  
Nobody’s righteous  
Nobody’s proud  
Nobody’s innocent

### Wait for Me

[HERMES]  
How to get to Hadestown  
You’ll have to take the long way down  
Through the underground, under cover of night  
Laying low, staying out of sight  
Ain’t no compass, brother, there ain’t no map  
Just a telephone wire and the railroad track  
Keep on walking and you don’t look back  
’Til you get to the bottomland  

[ORPHEUS]  
Wait for me, I’m coming  
Wait, I’m coming with you  
Wait for me, I’m coming too  
I’m coming too  

[HERMES]  
River Styx is high and wide  
Cinderbricks and razorwire  
Walls of iron and concrete  
Hound dogs howling round the gate  
Them dogs’ll lay down and play dead  
If you got the bones, if you got the bread  
But if all you got is your own two legs  
You best be glad you got ’em  

[ORPHEUS]  
Wait for me, I’m coming  
Wait, I’m coming with you  
Wait for me, I’m coming too  
I’m coming too  

[HERMES]  
You’re on the lam, you’re on the run  
Don’t give your name, you don’t have one  
And don’t look no one in the eye  
That town will try to suck you dry  
They’ll suck your brain, they’ll suck your breath  
They’ll pluck the heart right out your chest  
They’ll truss you up in your Sunday best  
And stuff your mouth with cotton  

[ORPHEUS]  
Wait for me, I’m coming  
Wait, I’m coming with you  
Wait for me, I’m coming too  
I’m coming  
Wait, wait, wait, wait

### Why We Build the Wall

[HADES]  
Why do we build the wall, my children, my children?  
Why do we build the wall?  

[ALL TOGETHER]  
Why do we build the wall?  
We build the wall to keep us free  
That’s why we build the wall  
We build the wall to keep us free  

[HADES]  
How does the wall keep us free, my children, my children?  
How does the wall keep us free?  

[ALL TOGETHER]  
How does the wall keep us free?  
The wall keeps out the enemy  
And we build the wall to keep us free  
That’s why we build the wall  
We build the wall to keep us free  

[HADES]  
Who do we call the enemy, my children, my children?  
Who do we call the enemy?  

[ALL TOGETHER]  
Who do we call the enemy?  
The enemy is poverty  
And the wall keeps out the enemy  
And we build the wall to keep us free  
That’s why we build the wall  
We build the wall to keep us free  

[HADES]  
Because we have and they have not, my children, my children  
Because they want what we have got  

[ALL TOGETHER]  
Because we have and they have not  
Because they want what we have got  
The enemy is poverty  
And the wall keeps out the enemy  
And we build the wall to keep us free  
That’s why we build the wall  
We build the wall to keep us free  

[HADES]  
What do we have that they should want, my children, my children?  
What do we have that they should want?  

[ALL TOGETHER]  
What do we have that they should want?  
We have a wall to work upon  
We have work and they have none  
And our work is never done  
My children, my children  
And the war is never won  
The enemy is poverty  
And the wall keeps out the enemy  
And we build the wall to keep us free  
That’s why we build the wall  
We build the wall to keep us free  
We build the wall to keep us free

### Our Lady of the Underground

[PERSEPHONE]  
I don’t know about you, boys  
But if you’re like me, then hanging around  
This old manhole is bringing you down  
Six-feet-under getting under your skin  
Cabin fever is a-setting in  
You’re stir crazy! You’re stuck in a rut!  
Or you could use a little pick-me-up  
I can give you what it is you crave  
A little something from the good old days  
I got the wind right here in a jar  
I got the rain on tap at the bar  
I got sunshine up on the shelf  
Allow me to introduce myself  

Brother, what’s my name?  
My name is…  

[CROWD]  
Our Lady of the Underground!  

[PERSEPHONE]  
Brother, what’s my name?  

[CROWD]  
Our Lady of Ways!  
Our Lady of Means!  

[PERSEPHONE]  
Brother, what’s my name?  
My name is…  

[CROWD]  
Our Lady of the Upside Down!  

[PERSEPHONE]  
Brother what’s my name?  
I’ll tell you my name…  
Persephone!  

Come here, brother, let me guess  
It’s the little things you miss  
Spring flowers, autumn leaves  
Ask me, brother, and you shall receive  
Or maybe these just ain’t enough  
Maybe you’re looking for some stronger stuff  
I got a sight for the sorest eye  
When’s the last time you saw the sky?  
Wipe away your tears, brother  
Brother, I know how you feel  
I can see you’re blinded by the sadness of it all  
But look a little closer, everything will be revealed  
Look a little closer, there’s a crack in the wall  

You want stars? I got a skyful  
Put a quarter in the slot, you’ll get an eyeful  
You want the moon? I got her too  
She’s right here waiting in my pay-per-view  
Oh, how long’s it been?  
A little moonshine ain’t no sin  
One at a time, boys, straight line  
What the boss don’t know, the boss won’t mind

### Flowers (Eurydice’s Song)

[EURYDICE]  
What I wanted was to fall asleep  
Close my eyes and disappear  
Like a petal on a stream, a feather on the air  

Lily white and poppy red  
I trembled when he laid me out  
You won’t feel a thing, he said, when you go down  
Nothing gonna wake you now  

Dreams are sweet until they’re not  
Men are kind until they aren’t  
Flowers bloom until they rot and fall apart  

Is anybody listening?  
I open my mouth and nothing comes out  
Nothing  
Nothing gonna wake me now  

Flowers, I remember fields  
Of flowers, soft beneath my heels  
Walking in the sun  
I remember someone  
Someone by my side  
Turned his face to mine  
And then I turned away  
Into the shade  

You, the one I left behind  
If you ever walk this way  
Come and find me lying in the bed I made

### Nothing Changes

[THE FATES]  
Why the struggle? Why the strain?  
Why make trouble? Why make scenes?  
Why go against the grain?  
Why swim upstream?  
It ain’t  
It ain’t  
It ain’t no use  
You’re bound  
You’re bound  
You’re bound to lose  
What’s done  
What’s done  
What’s done is done  
That’s the way the river runs  
So why get wet? Why break a sweat?  
Why waste your precious breath?  
Why beat your handsome brow?

Nothing changes  
Nothing changes anyhow

### If It’s True

[ORPHEUS]  
If it’s true what they say  
If my love is gone for good  
They can take this heart away  
They can take this flesh and blood  
Take my mouth that kissed her mouth  
Take my tongue that sung her praise  
Take my arms that used to reach out  
In the dark where she lay  

If it’s true what they say  
I’ll be on my way  

If it’s true what they say  
If there’s nothing to be done  
If there’s no part to be played  
If there’s no song to be sung  
Take this voice, take these hands  
I can’t use them anyway  
Take this music and the memory  
Of the muse from which it came  

If it’s true what they say  
I’ll be on my way  
We can all be on our way  
If it’s true what they say  

But the ones who tell the lies  
Are the solemnest to swear  
And the ones who load the dice  
Always say the toss is fair  
And the ones who deal the cards  
Are the ones who take the tricks  
With their hands over their hearts  
While we play the game they fix  
And the ones who speak the words  
Always say it is the last  
And no answer will be heard  
To the question no one asks  

So I ask you as a brother  
And I ask you as a friend  
And I ask you as a lover  
And I ask you once again  
Is it true what they say?

### How Long?

[PERSEPHONE]  
Hades, my husband, Hades, my light  
Hades, my darkness  
If you had heard how he sang tonight  
You’d pity poor Orpheus!  
All of his sorrow won’t fit in his chest  
It just burns like a fire in the pit of his chest  
And his heart is a bird on a spit in his chest  
How long, how long, how long?  

[HADES]  
How long? Just as long as Hades is King  
Nothing comes of wishing on stars  
And nothing comes of the songs people sing  
However sorry they are  
Give them a piece and they’ll take it all  
Show them the crack and they’ll tear down the wall  
Lend them an ear and the Kingdom will fall  
The Kingdom will fall for a song  

[PERSEPHONE]  
What does he care for the logic of kings?  
The laws of your underworld?  
It is only for love that he sings!  
He sings for the love of a girl!  

[HADES]  
You and your pity don’t fit in my bed  
You just burn like a fire in the pit of my bed  
And I turn like a bird on a spit in my bed  
How long, how long, how long?  

[PERSEPHONE]  
How long? Just as long as I am your wife  
It’s true the earth must die  
But then the earth comes back to life  
And the sun just goes on rising  

[HADES & PERSEPHONE]  
And how does the sun even fit in the sky?  
It just burns like a fire in the pit of the sky  
And the earth is a bird on a spit in the sky  
How long, how long, how long?

### Epic (Part II)

[ORPHEUS]  
Heavy and hard is the heart of the king  
King of iron, king of steel  
The heart of the king loves everything  
Like the hammer loves the nail  

But the heart of a man is a simple one  
Small and soft, flesh and blood  
And all that it loves is a woman  
A woman is all that it loves  

And Hades is king of the scythe and the sword  
He covers the world in the color of rust  
He scrapes the sky and scars the earth  
And he comes down heavy and hard on us  

But even that hardest of hearts unhardened  
Suddenly, when he saw her there  
Persephone in her mother’s garden  
Sun on her shoulders, wind in her hair  

The smell of the flowers she held in her hand  
And the pollen that fell from her fingertips  
And suddenly Hades was only a man  
With a taste of nectar upon his lips, singing:  

La la la la la la la…

### His Kiss, the Riot

[HADES]  
The devil take this Orpheus  
And his belladonna kiss  
Beautiful and poisonous  
Lovely! Deadly!  

Now it thickens on my tongue  
Now it quickens in my lung  
Now I’m stricken! Now I’m stung!  
It’s done already!  

Dangerous, this jack of hearts  
With his kiss, the riot starts  

All my children came here poor  
Clamoring for bed and board  
Now what do they clamor for?  
Freedom! Freedom!  

Have I made myself their Lord  
Just to fall upon the sword  
Of some pauper’s minor chord?  
Who will lead them?  

Who lays all the best laid plans?  
Who makes work for idle hands?  

Only one thing to be done  
Let them think that they have won  
Let them leave together  
Under one condition  
Orpheus, the undersigned  
Shall not turn to look behind  
She’s out of sight!  
And he’s out of his mind!  

Every coward seems courageous  
In the safety of the crowd  
Bravery can be contagious  
When the band is playing loud  
Nothing makes a man so bold  
As a woman’s smile and a hand to hold  
But all alone, his blood runs thin  
And doubt comes...doubt comes in

### Doubt Comes In

[ORPHEUS & THE FATES]  
Doubt comes in  
And strips the paint  
Doubt comes in  
And turns the wine  
Doubt comes in and leaves a trace  
Of vinegar and turpentine  
Where are you? Where are you now?  
Doubt comes in  
And kills the lights  
Doubt comes in  
And chills the air  
Doubt comes in and all falls silent  
It’s as though you aren’t there  
Where are you? Where are you now?  

[EURYDICE]  
Orpheus  
You’re shivering  
Is it cold or fear?  
Just keep singing  
The coldest night  
Of the coldest year  
Comes right before the spring  

[ORPHEUS & THE FATES]  
Doubt comes in  
With tricky fingers  
Doubt comes in  
With fickle tongues  
Doubt comes in and my heart falters  
And forgets the songs it sung  
Where are you? Where are you now?  

[EURYDICE]  
Orpheus  
Hold on  
Hold on tight  
It won’t be long  
’cause the darkest hour  
Of the darkest night  
Comes right before the dawn

### I Raise My Cup to Him

[EURYDICE]  
Pour the wine and raise a cup  
Drink up, brothers, you know how  
And spill a drop for Orpheus  
Wherever he is now  

[PERSEPHONE]  
Some birds sing when the sun shines bright  
My praise is not for them  
But the one who sings in the dead of night  
I raise my cup to him  

[EURYDICE]  
Wherever he is wandering  
Alone upon the earth  
Let all our singing follow him  
And bring him comfort  
Some flowers bloom when the green grass grows  
My praise is not for them  
But the one who blooms in the bitter snow  
I raise my cup to him  

[PERSEPHONE]  
I raise my cup and drink it up  

[EURYDICE]  
I raise it high and drink it dry  

[PERSEPHONE]  
To Orpheus and all of us  
Goodnight, brothers, goodnight
