Once there was a young man in search for himself who found death in Alaska instead. Then there was a news article 
followed by a book by the same author (Krakauer), and finally there was a movie (screenplay was adapted from the book). 
And then there was me, watching the movie.

I can't exactly say that I liked the movie, or that I could recognize or identify with the message it sent. However it 
has an amazing soundtrack (Eddie Vedder) with great lyrics, and it also has some broad, vague tone that I liked. I 
enjoyed watching the movie (many times), I always got touched by Chris' untimely end but I can't say that I understood 
him.

So I decided to track back, and try to find and understand everything that was potentially missing in the movie. And it 
turned out that there was only one more step that I could take - the book. Chris MacCandless did not leave enough of his 
own "voice" in the form of diary or letters to "speak" for himself, so, Krakauer gathered all available resources and 
filled in the blanks. And there were many blanks, so many that he had to stretch the available material as much as 
possible and fill it in with stuff unrelated to Chris' story, including accounts of his own (Krakauer's) Alaskan 
adventures.

To be honest, the task at hand was impossibly hard - understanding and deciphering intimate thoughts, goals, plans of an 
introvert person, mostly based on the stories of the people that he met.

At the end, I don't feel that I understand Chris MacCandless any better after I read the book, but I do know now some 
additional facts about his life and trips, things omitted or misrepresented in the movie. I was not too quick to judge 
him and his misfortune after I watched the movie, but even now I can't rationalize or approve the way he put himself in 
danger, nor what he was trying to achieve.
