This style of mixed POV chapters starts to bother me more and more. Every chapter seems to finish with a cliffhanger, 
and when the story comes back to that location, some time is lost, and it is briefly retold and mentioned in couple of 
sentences.

Maybe this is so (in contrast to the first 2 books) because the story finally starts to differ from the tv series, so 
there is more that is new to me.
