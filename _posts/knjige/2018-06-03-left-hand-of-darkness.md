excerpt:           "Nije na mene ni blizu ostavilo utisak kao the Dispossessed. U SF okruženju istražuje rodne uloge. 
                    Verovatno je knjiga bila kontroverznija kada je izašla - što je generalno dobra stvar, da se neke
                    kontroverze pomeraju i razrešavaju, ali za knjigu nije."

It was easy to read (except for all the alien names and alien units: fahrenheits, inches, feet, etc), but I expected 
more, something on a par with the Dispossessed. In the Dispossessed I really liked the ideas that it presented and 
developed, but here, after finishing I did not feel that I was left with something new. Maybe I just take for granted 
something that shocked people when the novel was originally published decades ago.
