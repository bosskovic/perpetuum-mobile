The story was known to me from the popular culture (ie Disney), but this is as close as I will get to the source, since 
I don't plan to read Kipling any time soon. If there are some political/cultural/philosophical undertones to the story, 
in the graphic novel they are lost and the story looks shallow. The graphics (drawings) are ok.
