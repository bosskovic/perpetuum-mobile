The vast majority of these ideas wont make an active 20+ months boy busy for more then a couple of minutes, and some of 
them will soon after that become a potential for a big mess in his hands.

Maybe we will have more luck with this book if the second one is a girl :-)


Many of the ideas are just slight variations that are there in order to pump up the number to 365 I guess...
