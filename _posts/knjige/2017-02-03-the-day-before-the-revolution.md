I'm considering reading of the Dispossessed, and I saw on Goodreads that this short story is listed as a prelude of that 
novel, and since it is so short I read it first. It's not really a standalone story, it would probably make much more 
sense to someone already acquainted with the world it takes place in.

But it got me interested, and I will read the Dispossessed soon enough for sure...
