Umberto Eco contemplates on what is fasciscm (in it's original Italian variety) and how the term became an all 
encompassing for many radically right wing regimes, parties, movements, individuals and tendencies, even though they 
may be quite different from each other.

Eventually he comes up with "Eternal fascism" (Ur-Fascism), and postulates 14 features (he observes himself that many 
of those are contradicting each other). It is enough that one of those features is present, he says, to allow fascism 
to coagulate around it.

Here's the summarised list of these features:
1. cult of tradition
2. rejection of modernism
3. action for action's sake
4. disagreement is treason
5. fear of difference
6. appeal to a frustrated middle class
7. obsession with a plot
8. enemies are portrayed as both too strong and too weak
9. pacifism is trafficking with the enemy
10. contempt for the weak
11. everybody is educated to become a hero
12. machismo via weapons
13. selective populism
14. use of an impoverished vocabulary
