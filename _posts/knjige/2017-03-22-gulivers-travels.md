This must have been thrilling, daring read when it was written 300 years ago, but I found it very boring and hard to 
read, and eventually I abandoned it after 2/3.

The edition that I read (Wordsworth Editions) has a great detailed preface and numerous footnotes that point out 
Swift's critiques of his contemporary (English) elites, which was nice to have, but I find this non-relevant today, 
and general thoughts and themes are buried deeply beneath descriptions of fantastic lands he visits and his experiences 
there.
