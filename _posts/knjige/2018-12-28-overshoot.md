<blockquote>
It has now become essential to recognize that all creatures, human or otherwise, impose a load upon their environment's 
ability to supply what they need and to absorb and transform what they excrete or discard. An environment's carrying 
capacity for a given kind of creature (living a given way of life) is the maximum persistently feasible load - just 
short of the load that would damage that environment's ability to support life of that kind. Carrying capacity can be
expressed quantitatively as the number of us, living in a given manner, which a given environment can support indefinitely.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Overuse of an environment sets up forces that will necessarily, in time, reduce the load to match the shrinkage of
carrying capacity.
