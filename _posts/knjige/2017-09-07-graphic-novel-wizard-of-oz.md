This is one of the books that I've been reading (or in fact more acting and interpreting) over and over again to my 3yr 
old kid, and as such it is mostly suited - colourful drawings that cover the narration frequently enough that we can 
follow it by hopping from one to another. There's too much killing, but I guess that in that regard the graphic novel 
is faithful to the source. Ok, I guess that the killing of two witches could not be avoided, but chopping off the heads 
of the wildcat or the whole wolf pack was too explicit and unnecessary...
