Nice illustrations but boring to read (ok, to be fair, it is not meant to be an easy read, it emulates the chronicles).

If you take into account that the source of this "knowledge" are the maesters, and that they have their own agendas, and 
what is written is not necessarily what was, but instead it is the history the way they want it told, so it gives an 
insight into their politics and conspiracies. It is interesting to see which rulers they praise.
