Finally a time has come for me to introduce my child to Tolkien! He is still too small (impatient and with a limited 
vocabulary) for me too read the whole thing to him, but the wonderful illustrations serve perfectly as an aid to tell 
and "act" the story to him, and prepare him for the real thing (still years in future) - the actual Tolikien's novel.

As mentioned, illustrations are beautiful (hand painted with water colour and pen) and the story is pretty true to the 
book (as far as I can remember), and I can recommend it to any Tolkien fan, and for those who aspire to become such it 
may be a good introduction but I would rather suggest to start with the novel, or otherwise you will be missing on 
Tolkiens wonderful language.
