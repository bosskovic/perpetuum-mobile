Less formal and easier to read then GoF Design Patterns, with many nice examples. And what is even better, it focuses 
on Ruby! It also includes many details on Ruby itself, which is great when it comes to the "tricks" you forgot about or 
never new, but mostly it just wastes your time. Better place for those would be in appendices.

I also noticed some errors in the examples code (ie defining attr_reader when clearly attr_writer is what is needed) and 
also some strange ways to write Ruby code, but all in all this is a great book.
