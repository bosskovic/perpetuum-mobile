Animal farm / novel by George Orwell --
From The rise and fall of the Soviet Union / history by Michael Kort --
The Stalin epigram / poem by Osip Mandelstam --
The rebellion of the magical rabbits / short story by Ariel Dorfman --
Crow song / poem by Margaret Atwood --
Harrison Bergeron / short story by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. --
The birds / short story by Daphne du Maurier.

Animal Farm is amazing, but the rest of the "related works" are mostly unremarkable. The final two short stories, 
Harrison Bergeron and The Birds I knew from before, as they were adapted into movies, and it was nice reading the 
source, but I fail to see how any of them is related to Animal farm.
