It has the atmosphere of the tv series, but the characters are little bit dumbed down and exaggerated: male characters 
were beefed up and female ones "boobed up", those that are strong - got stronger, tough - tougher, sexy - sexier, 
silly - sillier... it's less subtle. It does not add much to the overall story or the characters. Sheppard hitting 
Malcolm and deciding to leave the ship at the end seems somehow out of character...
