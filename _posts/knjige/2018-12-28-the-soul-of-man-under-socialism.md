oni koji se iz altruizma trude da ublaže posledice nepravednog sistema, time ga produžavaju i čine da neprihvatljivo
stanje izgleda prihvatljivijim 

    It is immoral to use private property in order to alleviate the horrible evils that result from the institution of private property.  It is both immoral and unfair.
    
    
    In fact, property is really a nuisance.
    If property had simply pleasures, we could stand it; but its duties make it unbearable.  In the interest of the rich we must get rid of it.
