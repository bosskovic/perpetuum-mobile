It is an autobiography, sort of, one that does not focus on deeds and achievements as much as it focuses on interests, 
"obsessions" and impressions, so after reading it, instead of feeling that I know about the man I have a feeling that I 
have known the man himself, that I can picture him in various situations and guess how he would have acted and reacted.

This is the man that I got to know: 

A strange man, indeed. At first I "judged" him a bit arrogant, always thinking how he's better and smarter then everyone 
else, those silly philosophers, biologists, mathematicians... but soon I changed my mind as I kept on reading. He does 
not care about being judged, and so he puts no effort at praises to himself or false modesties. He is either so sure of 
his place and reputation, or he does not care about them at all, that he would tell any story, however unexpected or 
controversial.

And he loves telling stories, and at moments you do wonder if he is joking, or making them up. I mean, can it really be 
a single man to take (a small) part on the development of radar, to take (a greater) part on development of atom bomb, 
to know and interact with some of the most famous scientist of his day, to be himself very successful scientist at 
several fields of physics and acknowledged by piers as such, at the same time to live the life to the full, to play in 
a Samba school (band) during the Rio carnival, to play bongo and other percussions and also to collaborate on writing 
and playing music for a ballet piece, to be an amateur painter, a one that sells, gets commissions and manages to put 
up a successful solo exhibition, to report that he managed to control his own dreams and managed to induce hallucinations 
and out of body experiences. 

There are probably some aspects to Richard Feynman that I missed to mention, but even with these, he lived lives of at 
least ten different men all condensed into one!

"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman" is very interesting and easy to read. It's a pity that a story on his plans to visit 
Tuva was not included...
