Nice historic overview that can be handled in several hours. I was disappointed with the emphasis given to the bombings 
and assassinations and extreme brevity of anything after ww2 (in total less then 10 pages). The first part (the 19th 
century) is ok as an introduction to the topic I guess.

As an excellent introduction to anarchism I would suggest <a href="/knjige/chomsky-on-anarchism/">On Anarchism</a> by 
Noam Chomsky, especially it's first two sections.
